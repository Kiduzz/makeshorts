[![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-Ready-2496ED?logo=docker&logoColor=white)](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

**Self-hosted AI video platform** with three tools in one: **Clip Generator**,
**AI Shorts (UGC videos with AI actors)** and **YouTube Studio**. Point it at a
long video and it hands back vertical clips ready for TikTok, Reels and Shorts.

![Your podcast, and the vertical clip Renomi makes of it: both speakers stacked, captions on the seam](screenshots/split-before-after.gif)

Two people on camera? Renomi stacks them instead of shrinking the wide shot,
puts the captions on the seam where they cover nobody, and switches back to a
face-tracked crop when the cut goes to one person. The AI picks the layout per
video; nothing to configure.

## How this runs

**Everything runs on your own machine — the app, the dashboard and every
video.** There is no hosted service, no account, no plan, no metering and no
watermark; the app never asks who you are. Clone it, `docker compose up`, and
open the dashboard on localhost. You bring your own API keys (Gemini, and
optionally ElevenLabs / fal.ai / Upload-Post) and pay those providers directly.
See [How much does it cost?](#how-much-does-it-cost) for what that comes to.

Nothing leaves your machine except the calls to those APIs. Your source videos
are downloaded, transcribed, cut and rendered locally, and the finished clips
sit in `output/` until you publish or delete them.

Anyone you share this with runs their own copy the same way, with their own
keys. There is no instance to sign up for, and no server of yours for them to
depend on.

> **The API has no authentication.** That is fine on localhost, and it is why
> `docker compose up` binds every port to `127.0.0.1` rather than `0.0.0.0` —
> otherwise anyone on the same café or office wifi could reach your API and
> spend your keys. If you ever change those bindings or put the backend on a
> public host, put your own auth in front of it first. `/mcp` is open too.

<details>
<summary>Running the dashboard somewhere other than the backend</summary>

The dashboard is a static SPA, so it can be built and served separately from
the API — a static host, another machine on your LAN. Point it at the backend
at build time:

```bash
cd dashboard
VITE_API_URL=http://your-backend-host:8000 npm run build   # dist/ is the deployable
```

Leave `VITE_API_URL` unset (the default) and it uses relative paths, which is
what the Compose setup wants. The backend answers CORS with `*`, so a
cross-origin dashboard works — but read the authentication note above first,
because a backend the dashboard can reach from elsewhere is a backend other
people can reach too.

## Key Features

### Clip Generator
- **Viral Moment Detection**: Google Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite analyzes transcripts and scene boundaries to detect 3-15 high-potential moments
- **Runs fully local if you want**: point `LLM_BASE_URL` at Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM or any OpenAI-compatible server and the moment picker runs on your own model, no Google key needed (see [Run without a Google key](#6-run-without-a-google-key-local-llm-optional))
- **Smart 9:16 Cropping**: AI reframing per scene — TRACK mode (MediaPipe + YOLOv8 face tracking), GENERAL mode (blurred background), SPLIT mode (two speakers stacked, captions on the seam) and SCREENCAST mode (screen over presenter); the layout is picked per video by Gemini or forced from the dashboard
- **Auto Subtitles**: faster-whisper with word-level timestamps, styled and burned into clips
- **AI Voice Dubbing**: ElevenLabs integration for 30+ languages with voice cloning
- **Hook Text Overlays**: AI-generated attention-grabbing text overlays
- **AI Video Effects**: Gemini-generated FFmpeg filters for professional effects

## How much does it cost?

Renomi itself is free. You provide the machine and pay only for the APIs you use, most of which have a free tier:

| Service | Free Tier | Paid Cost | Used For |
|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Google Gemini** | Free trial with generous limits | < $0.01 per 10-min video | Viral moment detection, script generation, web research |
| **Local LLM (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM...)** | **Free, your hardware** | $0 | Viral moment detection instead of Gemini (`LLM_BASE_URL`) |
| **fal.ai** | Pay-per-use | ~$0.50-1.50 per AI Short | Actor generation, talking head video, lip-sync |
| **ElevenLabs** | Free tier available | Pay-per-use | Voiceover, voice dubbing |
| **Upload-Post** | **10 free uploads/month** to all networks (no credit card) | Pay-per-use | Auto-publishing to TikTok, Instagram, YouTube |
| **AWS S3** | Optional | ~$0.023/GB | Cloud backup for clips and gallery |

**Bottom line:** You can clip videos for practically free with Gemini, and publish 10 videos/month to all social networks at zero cost with Upload-Post.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kiduzz/makeshorts.git
cd Renomi
```

### 2. Configure (optional)
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your AWS keys for S3 backup
```

### 3. Launch
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### 4. Open Dashboard
Navigate to **`http://localhost:5175`**

1. Go to **Settings** and enter your API keys (Gemini, fal.ai, ElevenLabs, Upload-Post)
2. **Clip Generator**: Upload a long-form video to generate viral shorts
3. **AI Shorts**: Describe your product or paste a URL to generate UGC marketing videos
4. **YouTube Studio**: Generate thumbnails, titles, and descriptions for YouTube
5. **UGC Gallery**: Browse all generated videos and avatars

### 5. GPU acceleration (optional, NVIDIA)

The default image is CPU-only. With an NVIDIA card (any card with NVENC, e.g. RTX 4060) an 8-minute video clips in about a minute instead of 5 to 8. Nothing is passed through in the VM sense — the container just gets access to the host GPU.

**Host:** install the NVIDIA driver (`nvidia-smi` must work) and the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html):
```bash
sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker && sudo systemctl restart docker
docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.4.0-base-ubuntu22.04 nvidia-smi   # sanity check
```
On Windows use Docker Desktop with the WSL2 backend and the Windows NVIDIA driver; no driver inside WSL.

**Compose:** create `docker-compose.override.yml` next to `docker-compose.yml` (picked up automatically). `GPU: "1"` adds cuBLAS/cuDNN and onnxruntime-gpu to the image (~2 GB); `video` is required for NVENC.
```yaml
services:
  backend:
    build:
      context: .
      args:
        GPU: "1"
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: all
              capabilities: [gpu, video]
```

**`.env`:**
```
WHISPER_MODEL=large-v3-turbo
WHISPER_DEVICE=cuda
WHISPER_COMPUTE=float16
FFMPEG_ENCODER=auto           # probes h264_nvenc at startup, falls back to x264
TRANSCRIBE_BACKEND=parakeet   # optional: ~2x faster than whisper, 25 European languages, auto-falls back to whisper
ASR_GPU_CONCURRENCY=1
```

**Verify:**
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
docker exec renomi-backend nvidia-smi -L
docker exec renomi-backend ffmpeg -hide_banner -f lavfi -i testsrc=size=256x256:rate=1 -frames:v 1 -c:v h264_nvenc -f null -
```
The backend log on the first job reports the chosen encoder and transcription device. A CUDA error in whisper (e.g. VRAM exhausted) retries once on CPU automatically. 8 GB of VRAM is enough for `large-v3-turbo` fp16 plus the detection models.

### 6. Run without a Google key (local LLM, optional)

The only cloud call in the clip pipeline is the moment picker: it sends the
transcript (never the video) to Gemini. Point it at any OpenAI-compatible
server instead and the whole pipeline stays on your box:

```bash
# .env
LLM_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1   # Ollama on the host
LLM_MODEL=qwen2.5:14b                                # any chat model that follows instructions
# LLM_API_KEY=...                                    # only if your server checks one (vLLM --api-key, OpenRouter)
```

Works with Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp server, LocalAI and OpenRouter.
The dashboard stops asking for a Gemini key when this is set. Two things to
know:

- **Context length.** A scoring call carries three transcript windows
  (~2-3k tokens) and the detail call up to ten (~5k on a long podcast).
  Ollama defaults to a 4096-token context and truncates silently, so run it
  with `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=16384` (or set `num_ctx` in a Modelfile); raise
  `LLM_SCORE_BATCH` above 3 only if your context allows it. 7-8B models
  return valid JSON reliably, 3B ones do not.
- **What still needs Gemini.** Anything that has to look at frames: the
  automatic layout picker (`AUTO_LAYOUT`), the on-screen content detector
  and silent videos (no speech to clip by). Without a Gemini key those fall
  back to the plain face-tracking crop, and a silent video fails with a
  message that says so. Add a key alongside `LLM_BASE_URL` and you get both.

## Technical Pipeline

### Clip Generator
1. **Ingest** — Local video upload (or self-hosted URL ingest via yt-dlp)
2. **Transcribe** — faster-whisper with word-level timestamps
3. **Detect** — PySceneDetect for scene boundaries
4. **Analyze** — Gemini identifies 3-15 viral moments (15-60s each)
5. **Extract** — FFmpeg precise clip cutting
6. **Reframe** — AI vertical cropping with subject tracking
7. **Effects** — Subtitles, hooks, AI video effects
8. **Publish** — S3 backup + Upload-Post social distribution

### AI Shorts
1. **Analyze** — Website scraping + Gemini web research (or manual description)
2. **Script** — Gemini generates viral scripts with segments
3. **Actor** — Flux 2 Pro portrait generation (or gallery/upload)
4. **Voice** — ElevenLabs TTS voiceover
5. **Video** — Hailuo 2.3 Fast img2video + VEED Lipsync (Low Cost) or Kling Avatar v2 (Premium)
6. **B-roll** — Flux 2 Pro image generation + Ken Burns effect
7. **Composite** — FFmpeg assembly with ASS subtitles and hook overlays
8. **Gallery** — Upload to public S3 with metadata for SEO pages
9. **Publish** — Upload-Post to TikTok, Instagram, YouTube

## Automate It: MCP Server, REST API and Webhooks

You don't need the dashboard. The whole pipeline is callable by AI agents and scripts.

### MCP server (`/mcp`)

Renomi ships a built-in [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server, so Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor or any MCP client can clip and publish videos for you:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http renomi http://localhost:8000/mcp
```

The endpoint takes no credentials — there is no user model to authenticate
against — so it is only as private as the network it sits on. A remote MCP
client (claude.ai, ChatGPT) needs a public HTTPS URL, which means putting your
own auth in front of it first.

Tools: `process_video` (URL or `upload_id`; `captions: false` when the source
already has subtitles, `auto_hook: false` to skip the hook line, burned by
default like the dashboard), `create_upload` (hand the agent a local file: PUT
the bytes, then process), `get_job_status`, `list_clips`, `add_subtitles`,
`recut_clip`, `publish_clip`. A prompt like *"clip this podcast and schedule the
best 3 to TikTok"* is a one-liner in your agent of choice.

### REST API

Every dashboard action is a plain HTTP call, unauthenticated:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=...", "acknowledged": true,
       "webhook_url": "https://your-server.com/hooks/renomi"}'
```

Interactive docs at `/docs` (OpenAPI) on any instance.

### Completion webhooks

Pass `webhook_url` (and optionally `webhook_secret`) to `POST /api/process` and you get exactly one `POST` when the job reaches a terminal state — no polling loops in your n8n / Zapier / cron pipelines:

```json
{"event": "job.completed", "job_id": "…",
 "clips": [{"index": 0, "title": "…", "video_url": "…", "download_url": "…"}]}
```

With a secret, the body is signed: `X-Renomi-Signature: sha256=<hmac-sha256(body)>`.

### CLI

The same API from the terminal, zero dependencies (`cli/`):

```bash
pip install ./cli    # not published to PyPI; install from this repo

export RENOMI_API_URL=http://localhost:8000   # defaults to localhost:8000

renomi process "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..." --wait
renomi clips <job_id>
renomi publish <job_id> 0 --platforms tiktok,youtube
```

### Agent skill

`skills/renomi/SKILL.md` follows the open
[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard, so it works in any
skill-capable agent:

```bash
# Claude Code (and most agents): copy the folder into the skills directory
cp -r skills/renomi ~/.claude/skills/

# Hermes Agent: install straight from this repo
hermes skills install Kiduzz/makeshorts/skills/renomi

# OpenClaw: from ClawHub
openclaw skills install @Kiduzz/makeshorts
```

### n8n

An importable workflow (video URL in, published-ready clips out, no polling)
lives in [`examples/n8n/`](examples/n8n/).
